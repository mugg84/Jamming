# Jamming
Project from Codecademy.
Implemented functionalities from original project.
Now each rendered song has its own image and if available a preview too.
Before you could just look for songs and create new playllists.
Now you caan retrieve all your existing playlists too and you can add modify them too.
In order to work a Spotify client key must be addded in Spotify.js.

What to do
I need to refactor it
